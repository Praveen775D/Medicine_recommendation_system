      <p>
        Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly platform powered by intelligent machine learning models, helping users identify potential illnesses based on symptoms and providing trusted guidance.

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        This platform uses a machine learning model trained on an extensive dataset of diseases and symptoms.  
        By entering the symptoms, the system predicts possible conditions and provides detailed guidance such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Diseases description</li>
        <li>Recommended medications</li>
        <li>Precautions</li>
        <li>Dietary suggestions</li>
        <li>Workout tips</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your Well-being, Our Priority</h3>
      <p>
        We understand that healthcare decisions are important and sometimes confusing.  
        That’s why this platform aims to give not just predictions, but complete information to support your physical and mental well-being.
      </p>
